Roundtable
##########

An obsolete application platform by SQuaRE
==========================================

At SQuaRE, we love building bots, microservices, and apps that help the `LSST Project`_ get its work done.
Roundtable was once a new initiative to bring many of these services under one roof to leverage common resources, like a Kubernetes cluster, HTTP ingress for APIs, Kafka for event-based apps, monitoring and logging, and continuous deployment patterns.
It has since been supplanted by `Phalanx <https://phalanx.lsst.io>`__, which contains a ``Roundtable`` project.  All new development of Roundtable applications should be done within Phalanx, and we are actively working on sunsetting Original Roundtable.
