Roundtable
##########

An application platform by SQuaRE for LSST
==========================================

At SQuaRE, we love building bots, microservices, and apps that help the `LSST Project`_ get its work done.
Roundtable is a new initiative to bring many of these services under one roof to leverage common resources, like a Kubernetes cluster, HTTP ingress for APIs, Kafka for event-based apps, monitoring and logging, and continuous deployment patterns.
At the same time, applications in the Roundtable are decentralized, and have a large amount of latitude to be developed and deployed independently.
